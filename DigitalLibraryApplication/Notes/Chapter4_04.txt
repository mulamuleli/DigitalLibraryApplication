View components

what are view components.
What are the benefits of using view components
how can we implement view Components.

 View Componnet are very simillar to the Partial Views but they are much more powerful than partial view.
  - this is because they dont use model binding
   and they ponly depend on the data provided when calling into it
  - they are intednded to be used anywhere where you have reusable rendering logic thats too complex for partial view..
  - they are typically invoked from layout page but you call also called it from anywhere. 
  benefits

  - it includes the same seraration of concern and testability benefits found between controller and view.
   we can have parameters as well as business logic attached to a certain view which is 

    structure of view components.
it is containing of  two parts the firts part 
1. the class that is deriving from the ViewComponents.
2. th resulst that it returns, typicall a view.

it is similar to trh view controller but on the smaller scale
 - yiu can crate smaller view components and in that way you can create the whole application 

 creating the view Component
 1. Deriving from ViewComponent
 2. we can be decorating a class with the [ViewComponent] attriute,or deriving from a class with the [ViewCompoment] attribute
 3.  create a class where the name end with the suffix ViewComponent

 lets get started.

 in index.cshtml

 create a new folder in the root of the application called ViewComponents
 - add a new class calle DummyAudioBookCreator

  we want to create an example of how you can create view component 

 - every viewcomponent must have  InvokeAsync method  in which we can  pass as much parameters we can but for now
 we will just pass one parameter which is called numOfAudioBooks and that is actually the number of  DummyAudioBookCreator that \
 that this method will create and then return it as a viewcomponentresult interface


 in the views folder add anotherfolder called Components
  add a new folder inside again called DummyAudioBookCreator
  - create a default cshtml file
      there you can write your logic

	   in the index use the @await compponent.InvokeAsync(DummyAudiocreator)
