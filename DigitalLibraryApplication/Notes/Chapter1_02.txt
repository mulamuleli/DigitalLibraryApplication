learning to create MVC projects 

MVC Architectural Patterns
 mvc= model-view-controller
 -  it sperates application into  three main group of components which ggives us a better seperation of concerns
  and  an easy way to achieve single responsibility prinsiples

  what realy happemns is :
  - user request are rouet to the controller
  - the controller works with the Model to process the request
  - after that the ontroller supplies back VIew and Model Data

1. models
- the model  is responsible for the aplication state and oerations on it
- it is alao responsible for the business logic 
- in our application there are different ways to imlement the model

         there are two types of model
		     1. Domain Model
			     - it include all teh abstractions an services that allow the controller to operate at a higher lelvel of abstraction
			 2. View Model 
			 - it is used to transfere data  that the vew requires for displaying purposes
			 3. Biniding Model
			 -  it uses a .NET Core mechanism that maps data from the http request to action or mehod parameters
			 - this model has no behavior and its just a simple contanier update
			 4. API Model
			 -it format the data into the form that is necessary for the api ...
			 - in this way we dont have to modify or  expose the api or change the internal logic or the data model
			 5 Persitsance Model
			  -  it is used to map data between in memory objects and the database

2. view
-   a viewer are used to present information to the user through user inteface
- theres no minimal amout of logic

3. controller
 controllers are components that handle user interactions
  - tey work with the model
  - the ultimatley select a view to render
  - in an mvc application the view only display information and the controller handles  response to userinput
  - the view also communicates witht the model that hadles business logic and get the proper information
