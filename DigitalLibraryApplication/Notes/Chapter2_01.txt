in this chapter we are ging to configure Entity Framework
- we will also learn how to use postgre SQL 
- we will see how we can add models and run migration
- we will also implemenservice layer patterns

      Configuring Entity Framework
======================================================================
* we need to see the overview of entity framework
* we will also have to see how to implement model and DbContext
* we will learn how to inject and configure DbContext

what is entity framework?
-  it is an Obeject-Relational Mapper(O/RM)
- it enables .NET developers to work with Database using .NET Objects.
- so it eliminates the need  for most of the data-access code thta developers usually need o write.

 entity framework workflow

 at the top we have:
 UI Layer >> Business Logic Layer >> Data Acces Layer [Entity Framework] >> DB


 EF benefits
 - cross platform
     you wil be able to run this code in mayplattfrom
	 querying is a lot easier. we will use linq 
	 transaction are automamtic
	 migrations


Approaches for EF
1. Database first approach
- we create a database and then use EF to create domain objects and to build code ontop
2. code fist approach
- we are gong to use this approach.
-in a nutshell we will fist write the code including the main objects and then entity framework will know how to create
know how to create tables with those onjects..

* start by creating classes for our domain that we will rely on
   -DbContext
      this way EF will know what need to be creaeted
	a class that require DbConext class should be derived from DbContext class
	 so that class will expose DB set properties for the types that  you want to be part of the  model


	working wiht Audio Books.

	1. Implement Model.
	  define model class
	  there wont be test

	2. Implement DbContext.
	 add a new class called DigitalLibraryContext in the Models folder
	 - add some constructors
	 - we need to register our context as a servies in our application using the 
	       


	3. Configure dBContext.

	up to this far we have configured our entity framework.....
