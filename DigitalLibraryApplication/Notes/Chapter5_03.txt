Using GitHub and Travis CI

here we are going to leanr how to connect travis with git hub
2. configuring buiil and testing on travis ci for .net 2.0
3. continuoous development example

open you git hub account
- you should have your porject on git hub
open you travis account
 - you can always connect your travis account with travis ci.
 - you can always snc accounts-
 - you can alson see  that you have your repository from git hub
 - you can turn on and turn off automatic buildsbut keep it turned on 

  before you start building your project on travis you have to make sure that you have a .travis.yml file

  in this file we are definging  what travis should actualy do
   ==========================================
   language: csharp
   solution: ./DigitalLibraryApplication.sln
   dist: trusty
   mono:none
   dotnet: 2.0.0
   install:
        - dotnet restore
	script:
	- dotnet build
	- dotnet test ./DigitalLibraryUnitTests/DigitalLibraryUnitTests.csproj

	 to test if this is working you will neet to add another test 
	 - cmmit the test to git hub  using git commit master
	 - open travic ci pannel to see if the build has already started

	  this is how we use Github & travic CI to build our application in continuous integration  manner
	  - we add tests  and it ill be automatically run in the build server as well
