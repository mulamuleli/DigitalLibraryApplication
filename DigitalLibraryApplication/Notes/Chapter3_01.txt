in ythe previous chapter we learned how to implement model and entity frame work

we are going to learn to writte frameworks for controllers..
1.  we are going to build two tyes of controllers.
   1. the restful api controller- restful API will help apis will be able to aces or data 
   2. the MVC Contoller - they rtun view operations and other operations..

lets start with resful  API  Controller 
 - we will learn what is a restful API and we want to implement this kind of API for AudioBooks.
  RESTful API
   Representational State Transfere (REST) is an architecture style that defnes a set of Constraints
   and properties based onf HTTP

   - it is an application program interface that uses http requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE some Data.
   
   the REST architectual style describes six Constraints..
      *  these constraints applied to the architecute were originally communicated by roy fielding in his doctral dissertation
	   - uniform interface
	   - client-server
	   - statelessness
	   - cacheable
	   - Layered system
       - code on demand

- fistly we are going to see how we extended AudioBookService
- we will then implement the method that will implement GET,POST,PUT AND DELETE in the AudioBookAPI controller.
- then we will test our application

 our controller will comunicate with our dataase access layer..
    eg the audiobook service which is wrapping up the entity frame work
	 we wiil have a RESTful API  Controller

	  routes are named automatically by the asp.net framework

	lets get started.
	1. un the IAudioBookService.
       - extend the methods.  
	        AudioBook GetById,Add,Update,Delete  

2. you can do the implementation in the AudioBookService class.
3. now add the AudioBookApiController- use an emptey api controller class
    - start by the test class in the Unitest classa
	  - start by implemnnting  a method that will get all audio books
	  then build it to see of there are dome errors..
4 if there are no errors you can then test the errors and run .....

for every method that we implement, we hve to run a test for it..

 lets ge started/.
