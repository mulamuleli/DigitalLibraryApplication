working with partial views

whare are partial views
benefits of using partial views
and implementation of partial views


1. partials are reusable views
2. these views are rendered whithin another view
3 that oother view is called a parent view, the HTML output generated by executing the partial  view is rendered 
  into the calling parent view.\


  2partial views eliminates duplicate codeding by resuing same npartial views in multiple place
  - we can also use these mechanism  to break up large views  into smaller components
  - it gives us a greater seraration of concerns
    -it give great implemetation of DRY prinsiples.


	creae a partial view

	 render the view where you want using HTML helper methods
	  - HTML.Partial()- this method renders the specified Partial View, it accepts partial view name as a string parameter and returns MvcHString
	  - HTML.RenderPartial()-  it is the same as the partial Method, except that it returns Void ad writes resulted HTML of a Specified Partial view into a HTT response stream directly.

	- HTML.RendorAction() - invokes a specfied controller and action and renders the results as a partial view.

	in our simple layout we ar going to do Html.RenderPartial("_Header");
