working with alternatve bdatabases for entityframework
 1. postgreSQL

 About PostgreSQL 
 - it is an Open Source , Object Relational Database Management System ( OSRDBMS) based on Postgres
 - developed at the university of California
 - it uses clients/serer model
 a server process- postgres, which manages the database files, accepts connection to the databases from client application
    and performs database actions on behalf of the client..

- if the client and the server ae on different hosts, they communicate over a TCP/IP network connection.



you can install postgresql from an exe file.
- install it..
-open pgAdmin 4
 authenticate.... to log into our PostgreSQL server


nw we need to intall a package into our DigitalLibrryApplication to run PostgreSQL

     run : dotnet dd package Npgsql.EntityFramework.PostgreSQL

	The big question i shuold we change anything in the DigitalLIbraryCOntext.cs class?
     - NO,

	  we only need to change the startup class and define a new service  which will use postgreSQL instead of SQLServer
	    and change the defaul cnnection 
		 in the startup class
		 this is what you hve to do   

		==================================
		    services.AddEntityFrameWorkNpgsql().AddDbContext<DigitalLibraryContext>(options => options.UseNpgsql(connection));
=============================================

 you also need to change the defaultConnetion String in the appsetting.json
 //"DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=DigitalLibrary;Username=postgres;Password=NikolAten111"

  check everything i postGreSQL
