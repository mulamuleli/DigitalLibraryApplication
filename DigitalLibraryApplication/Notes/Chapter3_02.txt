ew have implemented the RESTFUL api Controller
 now we want to write MVC controller.
 - wewill implement one controller manualy 
 - we will se how we can automtilly implement one

 1. we will add a test for functionality, 
 2. add implementation 
 3. add a simple view.

lets start wth the code

we need to have a new  interface class called IAudioBookServiceAsync..
 NB: in our index page we need to  to show a table with the following columns:
   title, sybtitile, summary,
   delete link and edit link and a create new book link or tab.

   1.we need 
   - an interface class and and  implementation of that interace class.
   - we are using async because we dont want to block our users/ or clients requests
   2. wealso need to ad a new controller called AudioBookManualController
   3. and another class callled AudioBookServiceAsync to implement our Interface for Audio book  
   4. you alwo need to create a manualcontroller test
   5. add a new folder in the views called AudioBookManual and add the following sub files;
      - Create.cshtml
	  - Delete.cshtml
	  - Edit.cshtml
	  - Index.html

	  we can also create mvc controllers in visual studio
