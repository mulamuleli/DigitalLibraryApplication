 creating a test project
 * wenwill learn how to create a test project in visueal studio.
 * we will spend a lot of time in this project running unit tests for our components

 in thius chapter we wil try to reate unit tests and integration nd functional tests for the ASP.NEt Core Application

 lets get started..

 * nest a new Project in  your DigitalLibraryApplication of type xUnit called DigitalLibraryUnitTests


 we can also use the Command LIne Tool in thestudion t create tests projects using the dotnet dependency manager..

===========================================================================================
 STRUCTURE OF OUR APPLICATION
 ==========================================================================================
  
#  The Program Class is the atual entry point of our Application. 
    - it has the main method and in the manin method we we calling the BuildWebHost() and Run() methods

	 the BuildebHost method is acually creating IWebHost
	 --   it is very important because  we are also using the startup class to configure everythung in our application

	  in the startup class we can create services using the ConfigureServices()  and we can also use the Configure() method
	  to register some middlewre which we will also dissuc in the futute

the question is how can we get to mimic this behavior in our program.cs in our tests. and that is our goal... we are also lucky because 
we have something called the test server
 now we well nned to create a new test called IntegrationTests.cs


  for now the the integration test is not  working and i dont know why but i will fix it later..
